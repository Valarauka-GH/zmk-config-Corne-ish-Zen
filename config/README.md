# A TKL-ish 42-key layout

![Keymap Image](keymap.png)

### Goal

The general idea for this layout is to retain most
of the muscle memory built up from years of using
tenkeyless desktop boards, or laptop layouts which
are largely similar, in a 42-key split form factor.
It should also adapt easily to non-split 40% or
4x12 ortho layouts like the Planck. 

This is intended to serve as an easy transition to an
ergo board for anyone coming from more traditional
layouts, in order to minimize the learning curve 
required. As such, more advanced concepts like
[home row mods](https://precondition.github.io/home-row-mods)
or dual-function keys are avoided in favor of having
dedicated keys for all modifiers, with one major
exception (more on that below).

### Base layer

```
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| ESC  |  Q  |  W  |  F  |  P  |  B  |     |  J  |  L  |  U  |  Y  |  ;  | DEL |
| BKSP |  A  |  R  |  S  |  T  |  G  |     |  M  |  N  |  E  |  I  |  O  |  '  |
| CTRL |  Z  |  X  |  C  |  D  |  V  |     |  K  |  H  |  ,  |  .  |  /  | GUI |
               | ALT | NUM | SHF/SPC |     | SHF/RET | NAV | TAB |
                         \-------------ADJ-------------/
```

The base layer uses Colemak-DH, but this can be
switched back to QWERTY with no issues. The modifier
keys take up mostly familiar positions on the outer
columns, and stay the same on all layers for easy
combination with numbers, symbols, and each other.
All of the modifier buttons can easily be swapped
around to individual preference, if other positions
feel more natural.

The primary "innovation" which enables the rest of
this setup is that the thumb Space and Enter keys
double as Shifts when held down. This allows for
comfortable typing of capital letters as well as
shifted symbols on any layer with either hand.

The concept is similar to the dual-thumb-key layers
in the [Seniply](https://stevep99.github.io/seniply/)
layout, except the "dual" key is just Shift fulfilling
its normal role. In order to allow for holding the
spacebar or Enter key when needed,
[quick-tap](https://zmk.dev/docs/behaviors/hold-tap#quick-tap-ms)
is enabled.

### Numbers and Symbols

```
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
|      | F1  | F2  | F3  | F4  | F5  |   | F6  | F7  | F8  | F9  | F10 |     |
|      |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5  |   |  6  |  7  |  8  |  9  |  0  |  `  |
|      | F11 | F12 |  [  |  ]  |     |   |     |  -  |  =  |  \  |     |     |
                   |     |     |     |   |     |     |     |
```

Rather than creating a numpad layout for numerals
and inventing symbol locations from scratch, we just
place a number row straight across the home row, and
use Shift to access the standard associated symbols.
Shifted symbols can be typed either using the Num
button on the left along with the right Shift key,
or by pressing both Num and Shift together with the
left thumb as a chord. 

The F-keys also go on the same layer, above the 
number row as usual. Only the farthest symbol
and F-keys have to move, to comfortable positions
on the bottom row. The backtick goes over the
quote character on the base layer, but this can be
moved below the `0` key if you prefer pinky downward
curls instead of outward shift. 

### Navigation layer

```
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
|      |     | BACK| HOME| PGUP|     |   |     |     | UP  |     |     |      |
|      |     | FWD | END | PGDN|     |   |     | LT  | DN  | RT  |     |      |
|      |     |     |     |     |     |   |     |     |     |     |     |      |
                   |     |     |     |   |     |     |     |
```

The nav layer holds a standard "inverted-T" arrow
cluster on the right hand, and the left holds the
rest of the navigation buttons, as well as
browser back and forward for convenience. The
arrows can be moved to the single-row "hjkl" setup if
preferred.

I rarely use Insert so didn't place it, but that 
can be added here as well, or PrintScreen, etc. 
There's also plenty of space free for adding
preferred shortcut or launcher keys.

### Adjust layer

```
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| RESET|     |     |     |     |     |   |     |VL_UP|PREV |BR_UP|     |      |
| BTCLR| BT1 | BT2 | BT3 | BT4 | BT5 |   |     |VL_DN|NEXT |BR_DN|     |      |
| CAPS |     |     |     |     |     |   |     |MUTE | P/P |     |     |      |
                   |     |     |     |   |     |     |     |
```

This is a "combo" layer, accessed by holding down
both layer keys, and holds keyboard, machine, and
media controls. Can be customized to preference,
or even omitted entirely.
